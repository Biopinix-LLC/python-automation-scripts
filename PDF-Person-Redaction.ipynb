To achieve this task, you'll need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Extract text from the PDF**: You can use libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` to extract the text from the PDF file.
2. **Identify named entities**: You'll use a library like `spacy` to detect the people (named entities) within the text.
3. **Highlight and redact**: To manipulate the PDF (highlight and redact names), you'll use a library like `reportlab` in combination with `PyMuPDF` (or `fitz` from the `PyMuPDF` package), which allows for drawing on PDF files.
4. **Save the modified PDFs**: For each identified person, you'll create a new PDF with the specified redactions and highlights.

Here is a basic step-by-step Python script outline you can run in Google Colab to accomplish this:

### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
First, install the required libraries:

```bash
!pip install PyPDF2 spacy PyMuPDF reportlab
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Step 2: Code to Process the PDF

```python
import spacy
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader, PdfWriter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
import io

# Load the spaCy model for named entity recognition (NER)
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Function to find named entities (persons) in text
def find_person_names(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    persons = set(ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON")
    return persons

# Function to create a new PDF with highlights and redactions
def create_highlighted_pdf(original_pdf, person_name, persons):
    # Read the original PDF
    doc = fitz.open(original_pdf)
    
    # Create a PdfWriter object to write the new PDF
    writer = PdfWriter()

    for page_num in range(doc.page_count):
        page = doc[page_num]
        page_text = page.get_text("text")
        
        # Prepare a new canvas for the page with highlights and redactions
        packet = io.BytesIO()
        can = canvas.Canvas(packet, pagesize=letter)
        text_instances = page.search_for(person_name)
        
        # Highlight the target person
        for inst in text_instances:
            can.setFillColorRGB(1, 1, 0)  # Yellow highlight
            can.rect(inst[0], inst[1], inst[2] - inst[0], inst[3] - inst[1], fill=1)

        # Redact other persons' names
        for other_person in persons:
            if other_person != person_name:
                redaction_instances = page.search_for(other_person)
                for inst in redaction_instances:
                    can.setFillColorRGB(0, 0, 0)  # Black redaction
                    can.rect(inst[0], inst[1], inst[2] - inst[0], inst[3] - inst[1], fill=1)

        can.save()

        # Merge the canvas with the original PDF
        packet.seek(0)
        overlay_pdf = fitz.open("pdf", packet.read())
        page.show_pdf_page(page.rect, overlay_pdf, 0)

        # Add the modified page to the writer
        writer.add_page(page)
    
    # Save the new PDF for the person
    output_filename = f"{person_name}.pdf"
    with open(output_filename, "wb") as output_file:
        writer.write(output_file)

# Main function to process the entire PDF
def process_pdf(original_pdf):
    # Read the PDF and extract all the text
    reader = PdfReader(original_pdf)
    text = ""
    for page_num in range(len(reader.pages)):
        text += reader.pages[page_num].extract_text()

    # Find all person names in the text
    persons = find_person_names(text)
    print(f"Found persons: {persons}")

    # For each person, create a new highlighted and redacted PDF
    for person in persons:
        create_highlighted_pdf(original_pdf, person, persons)

# Specify the path to the original PDF
original_pdf = "your-pdf-file.pdf"
process_pdf(original_pdf)
```

### Step 3: Running the Script in Google Colab

1. Upload the PDF file you want to process to your Google Colab environment.
2. Replace `"your-pdf-file.pdf"` in the `original_pdf` variable with the path to your uploaded PDF.
3. Run the script, and it will generate separate PDFs for each person identified in the document. The target person will be highlighted in yellow, while the other names will be redacted.

### Explanation:

- **Text extraction**: We use `PyPDF2` to extract the text from the PDF file.
- **Named entity recognition**: We use `spaCy`'s pre-trained English model (`en_core_web_sm`) to identify named entities, particularly people, in the text.
- **PDF processing**: Using `fitz` (from `PyMuPDF`), we find and highlight the specified person's name while redacting others.
- **PDF output**: The processed PDF is saved for each identified person, with their name highlighted and others redacted.
